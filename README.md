# cofi

A pet compiler project. Originally started out of curiosity and for educational purposes. *cofi* stands for *compiler first*. As the name implies, the language is/was of secondary concern. Primary goal designing and developing the compiler itself.

## How to build/run

To build

1. `mvn install` [java-commons](https://github.com/benschulz/java-commons),
2. `mvn install` [jswizzle](https://github.com/benschulz/jswizzle),
3. `mvn compile` this project

and to finally run, call

4. `mvn -f cofic-testing/pom.xml exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="de.benshu.cofi.cofic.Testing" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false`.

## Status

The compiler is in its alpha stage. It compiles the current "language runtime" and an interpreter runs the produced "binary" (a normalized and fully type-annotated version of the source code).

### Task List

The following things are next on the (long) to-do list. They are ordered by significance for some definition of significance.

1. **Syntax for variable get-access.** Currently any variable get of a variable `v` is explicitly written `v.get()`. This *turtles all the way down* approach is nice, but it hurts my eyes. There are two tasks here.
   1. Replace the handwritten parser with an ANTLR parser. It's sure to be more robust and give better error messages. Faster too, presumably.
   2. Try to allow user defined syntax transformation. This is where it get's tricky, also, fun.

2. **Higher kinded types.** The type system API and implementation are largely higher-kind ready. The biggest issue will likely be local type inference.

3. **Graceful error handling.** Most compile time errors lead to an exception being thrown. One exception is, for instance, provinding an illegal supertype (e.g. `FixList<E> extends List` is ill-kinded). This sort of graceful error handling should be extended to cover all compile time errors.
